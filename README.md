# Kinematics Solver

  Kinematics is often the first subject taught in a high school physics class.
  
  In kinematics, we explore how velocity and position change under a constant acceleration.
  
  We will consider five kinematic variables:
  
  Initial velocity vi, final velocity vf, change in position x
  
  duration time t, and acceleration a
  
  The rule is: if we know three of these five, we can solve for the other two.
  
  This solver will take three known variables and solve for the remaining two for you.
  

  If a variable is unknown, enter \"z\" to indicate an unknown.
